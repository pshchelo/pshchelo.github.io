Quite probably the best known puzzle in the world - cube consisting of 3x3x3 matrix of colored cubes, that can be rotated per layer.

Notation used
-------------
Choose the front face - the one facing you. Then the letters denote:

F
    rotate the front face of the cube clock-wise
B
    rotate the rear (back) face of the cube counter-clockwise (clockwise if you would make it front)
R
    rotate the right face of the cube upward (clockwise if you would make it front front)
L
    rotate the left face of the cube downward (i.e. also clockwise)
U
    rotate the top (upper) face of the cube to the left (i.e. clockwise)
D
    rotate the bottom (down) face of the cude to the right (i.e. clockwise)
M\ :sub:`R`
    rotate the middle slice of the cube upward (clockwise, as R turn)
M\ :sub:`D`
    rotate the middle slice to the right (clockwise, as D turn)
M\ :sub:`F`
    rotate the unseen middle slice clockwise (the slice between fron and rear faces)
G\ :sub:`R`
    rotate the whole cube upward (clockwise, as R turn)
G\ :sub:`F`
    rotate the whole cude clockwise (as F turn)
G\ :sub:`U`
    rotate the whole cube to the left (as U turn)

The primed letter means change of direction to counterclockwise: 
F', B', R', L', U', D', M'\ :sub:`R`, M'\ :sub:`D`, M'\ :sub:`F`, G'\ :sub:`R`, G'\ :sub:`F`, G'\ :sub:`B` .
