About
#####

I am Python developer with strong background in theoretical physics and
considerable experience in experimental biophysics. Having studied and
worked in science all over Europe for 12 years, now I live in Ukraine
and work in Kharkiv branch of `Mirantis
Inc <http://www.mirantis.com>`__. Currently I am involved with OpenStack
project, in particular Orchestration program (mostly
`Heat <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`__).

Here I will file various bits and pieces I stumble upon, mostly for
myself for future reference, but maybe someone else will find here
something useful too.
