About Me
########

I am Python developer with strong background in theoretical physics and
considerable experience in experimental biophysics.
Having studied and worked in science all over Europe for 12 years,
now I live back home in Ukraine in my home city Kharkiv.

Currently I am involved with `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org>`__ project,
in particular
Orchestration (mostly `Heat <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`__) and
Baremetal (`Ironic <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic>`__) programs.

Here I will file various bits and pieces I stumble upon, mostly for
myself for future reference, but maybe someone else will find here
something useful too.

Note on images
  I prefer plots and diagrams in SVG format.
  To support it in Pelican I use ``docutils`` patched as described
  `in this bug report <http://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/bugs/247/>`_.
  And if you don't see the image - try to use another, modern browser,
  they all support SVG from `<img>` tags now.

Contact
=======

I am too lazy to bolt Discuss etc support, so if you feel like letting me
know I am wrong somewhere, create an issue at
`this blog source repo <https://github.com/pshchelo/pshchelo.github.io/issues>`__.

Otherwise, I am usually to find on irc.freenode.net as ``pas-ha``.
