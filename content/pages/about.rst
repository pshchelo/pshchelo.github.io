About Me
########

I am Python developer with strong background in theoretical physics and
considerable experience in experimental biophysics.
Having studied and worked in science all over Europe for 12 years,
now I live back home in Ukraine in my home city Kharkiv.

Currently I am involved with `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org>`__ project,
at this time mostly with
Baremetal (`Ironic <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic>`__) program,
and previously with Orchestration
(`Heat <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`__).

Here I will file various bits and pieces I stumble upon, mostly for
myself for future reference, but maybe someone else will find here
something useful too.

Contact
=======

I am too lazy to bolt Disqus etc support, so if you feel like letting me
know I am wrong somewhere, create an issue at
`this blog source repo <https://github.com/pshchelo/pshchelo.github.io/issues>`__.

Otherwise, I am usually to find on
`irc.freenode.net <http://webchat.freenode.net/>`__ as ``pas-ha``.
