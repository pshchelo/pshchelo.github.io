About Me
########

I am Python developer with strong background in theoretical physics and
considerable experience in experimental biophysics.
Having studied and worked in science all over Europe for 12 years,
now I live back home in Ukraine in my home city Kharkiv.

Currently I am involved with `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org>`__ project,
at this time mostly with
Baremetal (`Ironic <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic>`__) program,
and previously with Orchestration
(`Heat <http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`__).

Here I will file various bits and pieces I stumble upon, mostly for
myself for future reference, but maybe someone else will find here
something useful too.
